# Pi Music Box

This project consists of the design and implementation of a system that reproduces melodies based on a microcontroller, which in our case is a Raspberry Pi 3. The system must reproduce a melody associated with an RFID card when the card is inserted into the system, stopping the reproduction of the melody when the card is removed.
